= App Mobility

== 1. Introduction

_In this exercise you will restore an OpenShift Virtual Machine to an alternate cluster from a Kasten backup._

____
[!CAUTION]

This exercise should be completed by the `cluster-1` user *_ONLY_*.
____

== 2. Creating an Import Policy

Unlike the "Snapshot" policy created in a previous exercise, an "Import" policy is used to import Kasten RestorePoints to a different cluster.

. In the *_Kasten Dashboard_*, select `cluster-1` from the multi-cluster dropdown menu and select *_Policies → Policies_* from the sidebar.
. Under your `kasten-lab-backup` Policy, click *_Show import details..._*.

. Click *_Copy to Clipboard_* to copy the migration token.
Save this value to be used in an upcoming step.

. Select `cluster-2` from the multi-cluster dropdown menu and select *_Policies → Policies_* from the sidebar.
. Click *_+ New Policy_* and fill out the following fields:
+
|===
|  |

| *_Name_*
| `kasten-lab-import`

| *_Action_*
| Select *_Import_*

| *_Restore After Import_*
| Click to enable

| *_Import Frequency_*
| Select *_On-Demand_*

| *_Config Data for Import_*
| Paste the migration token

| *_Profile for Import_*
| Select `global-profile-example`

____
[!CAUTION]

Ensure `global-profile-example` is selected, not `ceph-rgw-immutable` - this is because `global-profile-example` points to the backup repository on `cluster-1`, whereas the `ceph-rgw-immutable` profile on `cluster-2` points to its own, local Ceph bucket.
____

. Click *_Create Policy_*.
. Under the new `kasten-lab-import` Policy, click *_Run Once → Yes_* to initiate importing `kasten-lab` RestorePoints.
+

. Return to *_Dashboard_* in the sidebar and select the `kasten-lab-import` Policy Run under *_Actions_* to monitor status.
+

+
Once the Import completes, you should observe the Restore action start immediately, using the most recent `kasten-lab` RestorePoint.

. Once the restore completes, open *_OpenShift Console → Virtualization → Virtual Machines_* on `cluster-2`.
+

+
You should observe the `fedora-k10` VM from `cluster-1` running in the `kasten-lab` namespace (in addition to the `fedora-k10` VM cloned in a previous lab exercise).

== 3. Advanced Options

____
_What if you want to automate restoring the most recent backup to a standby cluster for DR or test/dev purposes?_
____

Simply update the `kasten-lab-import` Policy's frequency from *_On-Demand_* to the desired frequency (e.g.
Hourly, Daily, etc.).

____
_What if you need to make changes such as targeting an alternate StorageClass for restore or modifying the Route hostname?_
____

Kasten provides a robust transformation engine, allowing you to test, add, delete, copy, or replace key value pairs in a resource's manifest.

Check out the video below to see an example of creating and applying transforms to an application migrating from an on-premises OpenShift cluster to a ROSA cluster:+++<iframe width="847" height="476" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qocZk5fdxsY" title="Scaling Restore Operations with K10 Transform Sets" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="">++++++</iframe>+++

== 4. Takeaways

* Kasten backups can be restored to different clusters using Import policies
* Import policies can automate restore from the latest backup for use in DR or test/dev environments
* Transforms can be used to alter manifest specifications to aide in moving workloads between different clusters, storage, or clouds
