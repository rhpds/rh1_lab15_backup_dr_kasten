= Kasten Multi-Cluster

====
[WARNING]

This section is for your information only. You can not execute this section on this lab environment because for Red Hat One we are using a shared cluster for many users. Feel free to read through this section however to understand how you would set up Kasten for Multi-Cluster backup and restore.

The demo environment on the https://demo.redhat.com[Red Hat Demo Platform^] does not have that restriction. Feel free to use that environment after Red Hat One.
====

== 1. Introduction

Each Veeam Kasten deployment can function completely independent of other instances, without dependence on a separate customer-hosted or SaaS control plane - making it ideal for GitOps-style management and use in fully airgapped environments.
However, Kasten also provides a user interface for providing consolidated observability and centralized management of globally configured Kasten resources - *_Kasten Multi-cluster Manager_*.

'''

_In this exercise you will configure Kasten Multi-cluster Manager, join a second cluster, and distribute a centrally managed location profile to both clusters._

====
[IMPORTANT]

As each learner only has a single cluster, you will need to work with a partner, designating (1) user/cluster as `cluster-1` and (1) user/cluster as `cluster-2`.*
====

== 2. Configuring Primary Cluster

====
[CAUTION]

This section should be completed by the `cluster-1` user *_ONLY_*.
====

The *_Primary_* cluster defines and stores all global resources, such as Policies and Profiles, and also https://docs.kasten.io/latest/operating/monitoring.html#k10-multi-cluster-metrics[aggregates a subset of cluster metrics] for centralized reporting.

. In the *_Kasten Dashboard_*, select *_Multi-Cluster_* from the sidebar.
. Under *_Promote to Primary_*, click *_Setup_*.
+
image::module-04-multicluster/02.png[]

. Specify `cluster-1` as the *_Primary Name_* and click *_Promote Cluster ‚Üí Confirm_*.
+
image::module-04-multicluster/03.png[]
+
After setup completes, you should see the *_Multi-cluster Manager_* view.
+
image::module-04-multicluster/04.png[]
+
====
[NOTE]

A Kasten cluster can also be promoted to the primary cluster role declaratively using Helm/Operand parameters.
See https://docs.kasten.io/latest/multicluster/tutorials/getting_started.html#setting-up-the-primary-cluster-using-helm[docs.kasten.io] for details.
====

. Select *_Join Tokens_* from the sidebar and click *_+ Create New Join Token_*.
+
image::module-04-multicluster/05.png[]

. Specify `lab-token` as the *_Name_* and click *_Confirm_*.
+
image::module-04-multicluster/06.png[]
+
====
[NOTE]

Join Tokens are a type of Kubernetes Secret that can be created declaratively.
See https://docs.kasten.io/latest/multicluster/tutorials/getting_started.html#join-tokens[docs.kasten.io] for examples.

A single token can be used for multiple clusters.
Deleting tokens has no impact on clusters that have already joined multi-cluster, but will prevent additional clusters from joining using the deleted token.
====

. Click *_Copy_* to copy the token value to the clipboard and send the value to your `cluster-2` partner via one of the following:
 ** Email/Slack/etc.
 ** Slowly reading it aloud üò°
 ** Carrier pigeon ü™∂
 ** Writing it down on a Post-It and burning it after use ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
 ** Probably stick with Email/Slack/etc. üëç
 ** In real life, token values could be distributed to clusters using any Kubernetes Secrets management solution (ex.
Vault + External Secrets Operator)
. Click *_Done_*.

== 3. Joining Multi-Cluster from Secondary

====
[CAUTION]

This section should be completed by the `cluster-2` user *_ONLY_*.
====

. In the *_Kasten Dashboard_*, select *_Multi-Cluster_* from the sidebar.
. Under *_Join a Multi-Cluster System_*, click *_Join_*.
+
image::module-04-multicluster/07.png[]

. Paste the `lab-token` value from the primary cluster into the *_Token_* field.
+
====
[NOTE]

The join token also encodes the Kasten ingress URL required for a secondary to reach the primary cluster.
If an alternate URL is required in a production environment, this value can be overridden as seen in the UI.
====

. Specify `cluster-2` as the *_Local Cluster Name_* and click *_Use Current_* to populate *_Local Cluster Ingress_* with the current Kasten Route value.
+
image::module-04-multicluster/08.png[]

. Click *_Connect ‚Üí Yes_* to join `cluster-2`.
+
After a few moments you should observe the Multi-Cluster status page indicating the cluster has been connected to `cluster-1` as a primary.
+
image::module-04-multicluster/09.png[]
+
====
[TIP]

Joining secondary clusters can also be automated as part of a GitOps-style deployment by creating a `mc-join` Secret and `mc-join-config` ConfigMap on the secondary cluster to provide the join token and name/ingress details.
See https://docs.kasten.io/latest/multicluster/tutorials/getting_started.html#adding-a-secondary-cluster[docs.kasten.io] for details.
====

== 4. Managing Global Resources

====
[CAUTION]

This section should be completed by the `cluster-1` user *_ONLY_*.
====

. In the `cluster-1` *_Kasten Dashboard_*, select *_Multi-Cluster Manager_* from the dropdown menu and validate the *_Clusters_* page now displays both clusters.
+
image::module-04-multicluster/10.png[]

. Click the *_Grant Permissions_* button to configure permissions for the current *_Kasten Dashboard_* user.
+
This will pre-fill a form to extend the `k10-multi-cluster-admin` ClusterRole to the current user for all current and future Kasten clusters.
+
image::module-04-multicluster/11.png[]
+
====
[NOTE]

In a production environment this can be modified to give granular control over a subset of clusters to different users or groups.
====

. Keep the default settings and click *_Save_*.
. Select *_Clusters_* from the sidebar and click into `cluster-2` to validate it is accessible.
The sidebar dropdown menu can be used to browse between available clusters and the *_Multi-Cluster Manager_*.
+
image::module-04-multicluster/12.png[]

. In *_Kasten Multi-Cluster Manager_*, select *_Global Profiles ‚Üí Location_* from the sidebar and click *_+ New Profile_*.
+
image::module-04-multicluster/13.png[]

. Fill out the following fields and click *_Next_*:
+
|===
|  |

| *_Profile Name_*
| `global-profile-example`

| *_Storage Provider_*
| S3 Compatible
|===

. In the *_Web Terminal_*, run the following to fetch your existing Ceph Object Gateway bucket details:
+
[,bash]
----
 export CEPH_S3_ENDPOINT="https://$(oc get route \
   s3 -n openshift-storage -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')"
 export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$(oc get secret \
   rook-ceph-object-user-ocs-storagecluster-cephobjectstore-ocs-storagecluster-cephobjectstoreuser \
   -n openshift-storage -o jsonpath='{.data.AccessKey}' | base64 --decode)
 export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$(oc get secret \
   rook-ceph-object-user-ocs-storagecluster-cephobjectstore-ocs-storagecluster-cephobjectstoreuser \
   -n openshift-storage -o jsonpath='{.data.SecretKey}' | base64 --decode)

 printf '%s\n' 'ACCESS KEY:' ${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID} 'SECRET KEY:' ${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY} 'ENDPOINT:' ${CEPH_S3_ENDPOINT}
----

. Return to the *_Kasten Multi-Cluster Manager_* and fill out the following fields:
+
|===
|  |

| *_S3 Access Key_*
| Paste `ACCESS KEY` value

| *_S3 Secret_*
| Paste `SECRET KEY` value

| *_Endpoint_*
| Paste `ENDPOINT` value

| *_Region_*
| `us-east-1`

| *_Bucket_*
| `kasten`
|===
+
image::module-04-multicluster/14.png[]

. Click *_Next ‚Üí Submit_*.
. Select *_Distributions_* from the sidebar and click *_+ New Distribution_*.
+
Distributions define which global resources should be synced with which clusters, allowing administrators to define label-based rules to automate resource distribution for new Kasten installs joining multi-cluster.

. Fill out the following fields:
+
|===
|  |

| *_Name_*
| `example-distribution`

| *_Clusters_*
| Select `dist.kio.kasten.io/cluster-type:primary`

|
| Select `dist.kio.kasten.io/cluster-type:secondary`

| *_Resources_*
| Select `global-profile-example`
|===
+
image::module-04-multicluster/15.png[]
+
This configuration will ensure the `global-profile-example` Location Profile is synced to all current and future Kasten clusters.

. Click *_Add Distribution_*.
+
You should observe that the distribution has been synced to the selected clusters.
+

You can view a summary of global resources for each cluster from the *_Multi-Cluster_* status page as shown below.

== 5. Takeaways

* Kasten Multi-Cluster Manager provides an interface for administrators to manage many Kasten deployments from a single interface
* Kasten policies and profiles can be centrally defined to simplify change management and ensure consistency across large environments
