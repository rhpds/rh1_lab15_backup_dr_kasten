= Installing Veeam Kasten

== 1. Introduction

This add-on lab guide is intended to familiarize practitioners with the protection of OpenShift Virtualization workloads using *_Veeam Kasten for Kubernetes_*.
It assumes the learner has completed other *_OpenShift Virtualization Roadshow_* lab exercises and are familiar with virtual machine provisioning and management in OpenShift.

=== What is Veeam Kasten?

*_Veeam Kasten for Kubernetes_* is a purpose-built data protection solution for Kubernetes that enables organizations to perform backup & restore, disaster recovery, and cross-cluster mobility of their applications.

=== How does Kasten work?

image::module-01-install/00.png[]

. Kasten is deployed to the cluster that it protects.
Within the cluster, Kasten communicates with the Kubernetes API server to discover applications and their resources.
. Kasten orchestrates point-in-time snapshots of complete applications, including both application manifest data and storage volume data.
. Kasten exports portable copies of the point-in-time snapshot to an external object, NFS, or Veeam repository.

====
[IMPORTANT]

We have pre-staged the lab with an install of Veeam Kasten, so there's no need to complete the steps in Section 2.
Rather, this section just highlights how'd you go about installing Kasten if it were not already installed on the OpenShift cluster.

Make sure you follow the instructions to access the Kasten K10 Dashboard in section 3 of this lab though!
====

== 2. Installing Kasten

. In the *_OpenShift Console_*, search for `Kasten` in the *_OperatorHub_* and select *_Kasten K10 (Free)_*:

+
====
[NOTE]

Alternate versions of the Kasten operator are available for use if transacting Kasten licensing through the Red Hat Marketplace.

If desired, Kasten may also be https://docs.kasten.io/latest/install/openshift/helm.html#helm-based-installation[installed on OpenShift via Helm chart].
====

. Under *_Version_*, select `7.0.12` from the dropdown menu, and click *_Install_*.
+

+
====
[IMPORTANT]

It's recommended to always run the latest available version of Kasten.
Explicitly selecting version `7.0.12` is to ensure consistent instructions and corresponding screenshots in this lab guide.
====

. Under *_Update approval_* select *_Manual_* and then click *_Install_* to initiate operator installation.
+
image::module-01-install/03.png[]

. When prompted, click *_Approve_* to proceed with operator installation.
+
image::module-01-install/03b.png[]

. After operator installation completes, click *_View Operator_* (or select *_Operators → Installed Operators → Kasten K10 (Free)_* from the sidebar).
. Under *Provided APIs - K10*, click *_+ Create instance_*.
+
image::module-01-install/04.png[]

. Select *_YAML view_* and overwrite the default options with the configuration below:
+
[source,yaml]
----
 apiVersion: apik10.kasten.io/v1alpha1
 kind: K10
 metadata:
   name: k10
   namespace: kasten-io
   annotations:
     helm.sdk.operatorframework.io/rollback-force: 'false'
 spec:
   auth:
     openshift:
       enabled: true
       dashboardURL: https://k10-route-kasten-io.apps.YOUR-WORKSHOP-ID.dynamic.redhatworkshops.io/k10
       openshiftURL: https://apiserver.openshift-kube-apiserver.svc.cluster.local
       insecureCA: true
   route:
     enabled: true
     tls:
       enabled: true
----

. Replace `YOUR-WORKSHOP-ID` with the 5 character identifier for your lab environment DNS, as shown in the screenshot below:
+
image::module-01-install/05b.png[]
+
This configuration will enable integration with the built-in OpenShift OAuth server and the creation of a `Route` for secure, multi-user access to the Kasten dashboard.
+
====
[NOTE]

A complete list of configuration parameters is available on https://docs.kasten.io/latest/install/advanced.html#complete-list-of-k10-helm-options[docs.kasten.io].
====

. Click *_Create_*.
. Open the *_Web Terminal_* and click *_Start_* to initialize the terminal (if prompted).
+
image::module-01-install/01.png[]

. From the *_Web Terminal_*, run the following to monitor the installation:
+
[,bash]
----
 watch oc get pods -n kasten-io
----

. Once all Deployments are `READY`, press `CTRL+C` to end the `watch`.
+
image::module-01-install/06.png[]

. As a final deployment step, annotate the available VolumeSnapshotClasses for use with Kasten:
+
[,bash]
----
 oc annotate volumesnapshotclass \
   ocs-external-storagecluster-rbdplugin-snapclass  \
   k10.kasten.io/is-snapshot-class=true

 oc annotate volumesnapshotclass \
   ocs-external-storagecluster-cephfsplugin-snapclass \
   k10.kasten.io/is-snapshot-class=true
----
+
====
[IMPORTANT]

The `k10.kasten.io/is-snapshot-class` annotation is used by Kasten to determine which VolumeSnapshotClass should be used by Kasten to request CSI snapshots for PersistentVolumes provisioned by a given CSI provider.
====

. Close the *_Web Terminal_*.

== 3. Accessing the Kasten Dashboard

. In a web browser navigate to the {kasten_dashboard}[Kasten Dashboard^].
You should be redirected to the OpenShift OAuth login prompt.

. Use your OpenShift Console credentials provided as part of your lab environment and click *_Log-in_*.
.. *User ID*: `{user}`
.. *Password*: `{password}`
+
image::module-01-install/08.png[]

. When prompted, select *_Allow selected permissions_* to allow Kasten read-only access to username and group membership details from the OpenShift OAuth server.
. Specify your *_Email Address_* and *_Company_* values and click *_Accept Terms_*.
+
image::module-01-install/09.png[]
+
You should observe that the *_Kasten Dashboard_* is being accessed as your individual user.
+
image::module-01-install/10.png[]
+
====
[NOTE]

Kasten ships with multiple built-in user roles, including `k10-admin` and `k10-basic`.
As Kasten is built on Kubernetes-native resources, custom roles can be built and bound to users/groups to define fine-grained access on a per namespace level.

This helps to allow secure self-service for end users who may need to manage their own policies or restores without dependence on a data protection administrator.

Your user has been granted the `k10-admin` role.
